This is a basic Work Day Planner with the JavaScript done completely by myself and though it was done in advance i also did some tweaking to both the html and css to make it more understandable by myself. The website will tell you the current day at the top of the page. When you type something into each hour area you can press the save button which will save it to local storage and upon page refresh the inputs will be loaded from localStorage. The input areas are also color coded based on the time of day using moment.
